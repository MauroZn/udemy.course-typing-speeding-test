## Assignment
Using Tkinter and what you have learnt about building GUI applications with Python, build a desktop app that assesses your typing speed. Give the user some sample text and detect how many words they can type per minute.<br>
The average typing speed is 40 words per minute. But with practice, you can speed up to 100 words per minute.
